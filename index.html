                <p class="bioText">Jonathan Pickard is a full stack development student in the UPenn LPS Bootcamp course. Throughout his life Jonathan has found himself
                    driven by a strong competitive spirit. This competitive spirit was first manifested in his love for basketball. With achievements such as being voted MVP and solo team captain
                    beginning his junior year, Jonathan found himself poised for a successful collegiate career. Unfortunately an elbow injury would cut that career short.

                <br>
                <p class="bioText">Not one to sit idle, Jonathan quickly channeled that competitive enery into something else he loved, eSports. As a relatively unknown
                    team leader he took his first team to a 7th place finish in his first world championship appearance. 11 years of competitive domination would pass in 
                    what is considered one of the most successful eSports careers in North America.

                <br>
                <p class="bioText">Hitting an age where the 18 hour a day grind and constant travel were no longer as appealing, Jonathan again transitioned into something
                    he was passionate about, the craft beer scene. As the head bartender and bar manager at a craft beer bar Jonathan has established himself as a leading
                    expert on all things craft beer. In July he will be honored with the Best of the Mainline award for craft beer knowledge.

                <br>
                <p class="bioText">With one last career pivot Jonathan is entering the world of full stack web development. In the field of technology there is no limit
                    to what can be learned and applied which is the perfect outlet for the competitive spirit that has driven Jonathan to be successful in all his past 
                    endeavors.

                <p class="bioText">Jonathan would like to thank you for taking the time to read his bio and he looks forward to talking with you soon.</p>
